        "abstract": "\"{This paper focuses on the development of the kinematics and dynamics model of an omnidirectional four Mecanum wheeled robot for the purposes of motion control. The kinematic model is implemented to calculate the RPM of each wheel and control the motors. The model allows for the evaluation of drift of the body and a feedback loop implemented in conjunction with odometry to adjust the trajectory of the robotic platform. This considers route length, pose efficiency, necessity of acceleration, and smoothness of motion.This analysis focuses on the determination of effects from slippage of the roller on the shaft connecting it to a wheel while considering the physical geometry of the robotics platform. In doing so, a more accurate kinematic and dynamics model for an omnidirectional platform is created and simulation is conducted in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The inverse kinematics is also presented in this paper. The authors illustrate the validity of this extensive model through experimental and analytical position tracking of the physical system in eight planar directions: forward/backward, laterally, and along 45-degree angle, as well as in two rotating directions. The dynamics model can be used to understand the performance of the mobile robot and further be used to design the control algorithm for object avoidance.}\",",

        "abstract": "Path planning is one of the indispensable modules of autonomous mobile robots that delineates a collision-free path between two desired positions in an obstacle-cluttered workspace. In this paper, we propose a global path planning method in the image plane using a single overhead camera based on the principle of artificial potential fields. Our algorithm optimally fuses an image-based technique for obstacle avoidance with path planning in the image space and integrates the CAD-based recognition method. The proposed method is suitable for planning the desired path for the omnidirectional mobile robots, and it is used as an input to our previously developed path-following controller. Experiment results show the efficiency of the generated path using an overhead camera for the omnidirectional robot iMoro which is a four-wheeled, independently steered mobile robot.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an active visual SLAM approach for omnidirectional robots. The goal is to generate control commands that allow such a robot to simultaneously localize itself and map an unknown environment while maximizing the amount of information gained and consuming as low energy as possible. Leveraging the robot\u2019s independent translation and rotation control, we introduce a multi-layered approach for active V-SLAM. The top layer decides on informative goal locations and generates highly informative paths to them. The second and third layers actively re-plan and execute the path, exploiting the continuously updated map and local features information. Moreover, we introduce two utility formulations to account for the presence of obstacles in the field of view and the robot\u2019s location. Through rigorous simulations, real robot experiments, and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate that our approach achieves similar coverage results with lesser overall map entropy. This is obtained while keeping the traversed distance up to 39% shorter than the other methods and without increasing the wheels\u2019 total rotation amount. Code and implementation details are provided as open-source, and all the generated data is available online for consultation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The omnidirectional drive is a popular challenging trend in today's mobile robotics where different areas such as swarm, humanoid, legged, train-based, underwater, air flying, and wheeled mobile robotics have been involved. Among them all, Omnidirectional Wheeled Mobile Robots (OMR) due to their low cost, simplicity, and their power in navigation have attracted a significant number of applications in various environments. Different wheel mechanisms including different mechanical wheel designs and various wheel topologies, and different navigation approaches, including control, driving, path planning methods and etc., are designed to achieve omnidirectional drive with different characteristics. For instance, some works attempt to reach a better speed, some others increase the robot's payload capacity, some works improve the motion stabilization and some others deal with uncertainty, vibration, slippage, and etc. In this paper, we present a review of the most effective omnidirectional wheel mechanisms and present the main challenges and navigation approaches that play important roles in OMR development. The important background works regarding each wheel mechanism are presented, the most important wheel mechanisms are presented and the current trending approaches are presented in order to assist designers and researchers to select appropriate mechanism and control approach fit to their requirements.",

        "abstract": "An Informed RRT* (IRRT*) algorithm is one of the optimized versions of a Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm which finds near-optimal solutions faster than RRT and RRT* algorithms by restricting the search area to an ellipsoidal subset of the state space. However, IRRT* algorithm has the disadvantage of randomness of sampling and a non-real time process, which has a negative impact on the convergence rate and search efficiency in path planning applications. In this paper, we report a hybrid algorithm by combining the Artificial Potential Field Method (APF) with an IRRT* algorithm for mobile robot path planning. By introducing the virtual force field of APF into the search tree expansion stage of the IRRT* algorithm, the guidance of the algorithm increases, which greatly improves the convergence rate and search efficiency of the IRRT* algorithm. The proposed algorithm was validated in simulations and proven to be superior to some other RRT-based algorithms in search time and path length. It also was performed in a real robotic platform, which shows that the proposed algorithm can be well executed in real scenarios.",

        "abstract": " Mecanum wheels are widely used in omnidirectional vehicles, but their arrangements are usually arbitrarily selected. We find that the arrangement of Mecanum wheels influences the performance of an omnidirectional vehicle. The two most used arrangement modes, Type-X and Type-O, are studied. The inverse velocity Jacobian matrix of the arrangement judges whether a vehicle can fulfill omnidirectional movement. The eigenvalues of the inverse velocity Jacobian matrix and global stiffness index are proposed to evaluate the stability and dexterity of different arrangement modes. The theoretical results show that the Type-X vehicle has a larger stiffness and global stiffness index than the Type-O vehicle, which ensures that the Type-X vehicle moves more precisely and stably than the Type-O vehicle. Four types of movements (straight, sideways, diagonal, and revolving) are tested for both arrangements. The experiments show that the actual running tracks of Type-X follow the ideal running tracks well, while the performance of Type-O is much worse. Moreover, an external force is subjected to both arrangements. The results illustrate that the behavior of the Type-X vehicle is more stable than that of Type-O.",

        "abstract": "The motion-planning problem is well known in robotics; it aims to find a free-obstacle path from a starting point to a destination. To make use of actuation generosity and the fuzzy fast response behavior compared to other non-linear controllers, a fuzzy-based fault-tolerant control for an omnidirectional mobile robot with four Mecanum wheels is proposed. The objective is to provide the robot with an online scheme to control the robot motion while moving toward the final destination with avoiding obstacles in its environment and providing an adaptive solution for a combination of one or combination of the wheel&rsquo;s faults. The faults happen when the wheel does not receive the control command signal from the controller; in this case, the robot can rotate freely due to the interaction with the ground. The principle of fuzzy-based control proposed by Sugeno is used to develop the motion controller. The motion controller consists of two main controllers: the Run-To-Goal, and the obstacle-avoidance controller. The outputs of these two controllers are superposed to get the net potential force on the robot. By its simplicity, the fuzzy controller can be suitable for online applications (online path planning in our case). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fuzzy-based fault-tolerant controller for an omnidirectional robot. The proposed controller is tested by a set of simulation scenarios to check the proposed fuzzy tolerant control. Kuka OmniRob is used as an example of the omnidirectional robot in these simulation runs. Matlab is used to build the fuzzy-based fault-tolerant control, and the 3D simulation is developed on the CoppeliaSim software. We examine five distinct scenarios, each one with a different fault state. In all scenarios, the proposed algorithm could control the robot to reach its final destination with the absence and presence of an obstacle in the workspace, despite actuator faults, without crossing the workspace boundaries.",

        "abstract": "Motion control in dynamic environments is one of the most important problems in using mobile robots in collaboration with humans and other robots. In this paper, the motion control of a four-Mecanum-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot (OMR) in dynamic environments is studied. The robot\u2019s differential equations of motion are extracted using Kane\u2019s method and converted to discrete state space form. A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) strategy is designed based on the derived mathematical model to stabilize the robot in desired positions and orientations. As a main contribution of this work, the velocity obstacles (VO) approach is reformulated to be introduced in the NMPC system to avoid the robot from collision with moving and fixed obstacles online. Considering the robot\u2019s physical restrictions, the parameters and functions used in the designed control system and collision avoidance strategy are determined through stability and performance analysis and some criteria are established for calculating the best values of these parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed controller and collision avoidance strategy is evaluated through a series of computer simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy is efficient in stabilizing the robot in the desired configuration and in avoiding collision with obstacles, even in narrow spaces and with complicated arrangements of obstacles.",
